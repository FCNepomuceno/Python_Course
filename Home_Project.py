################ HOME PROJECT #####################

# The goal of this exercise is to instigate you to solve problems on your own with python

# WHAT TO DO? 
# 1 - Create a routine that will be able to read a csv file and save a plot for each column present in the dataframe separately
# 2 - Create a routine to plot only columns that match arguments passed to the program

# Some tips for you:
#   - Put the data from .csv into a dataframe
#   - Iterate over the dataframe columns (Iterate -> Control Flow [if, for, while])
#   - Use always the same X-axis
#   - Careful about the placement of functions in loops and identation
#   - The function 'print' may help you understand what is going on, when used right
